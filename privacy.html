  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p>Last updated: July 2, 2025</p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>Multi-Image Downloader</strong> (the “Extension”) is a Chrome browser extension that allows users to select and download images from web pages or save them to their Pinterest boards. This privacy policy explains what information the Extension collects, how it is used, and your choices.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension <strong>does not</strong> collect or transmit any personally identifiable information (names, email addresses, device identifiers, etc.) from your browser to our servers or any third parties.
  </p>

  <h2>3. OAuth & Tokens</h2>
  <p>
    If you choose to “Save to Pinterest,” the Extension uses Chrome’s built-in <code>chrome.identity</code> API to obtain an OAuth access token directly from Pinterest. Your Pinterest credentials and tokens are handled by Pinterest’s secure authorization endpoint and are <strong>never</strong> stored or transmitted by us. The token lives only in your browser session.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Local Processing</h2>
  <p>
    All image collection, sorting, and downloading logic runs <em>entirely</em> in your browser. No image URLs or content are sent to any external server except when you explicitly request to pin to Pinterest (in which case the URL is posted directly to Pinterest’s API).
  </p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    The only third-party API used is Pinterest’s. Please refer to their <a href="https://policy.pinterest.com/en/privacy-policy" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> for how they handle your data when you pin images.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Cookies & Storage</h2>
  <p>
    The Extension does not set or read cookies. Any caching of image URLs or thumbnails is done in-memory in your browser popup page and is cleared when you close it.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This Extension is not intended for use by children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the “Last updated” date at the top. Continued use of the Extension after changes will constitute acceptance of the new policy.
  </p>
